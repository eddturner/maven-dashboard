how to setup poms for reading by angularjs app.
1. get pom: either from git repo, or get all of them via ./get_poms.sh
2. organiseInFs for the pom, to copy it to a prettier directory based on version and artifact
2.a. may need to batch run organiseInFS, so if we need to quickly recreate all (if error occurs), then we can do so.
3. pom2effectiveAndGraph for the poms in the organised directories. this will create effective poms, and graphs (xml format) for them in teh same directory
3.a. may need to batch run pom2effectiveAndGraph, this can be done by file globbing the passed script parameter

todo:
* create batch runner of organiseFS:
done
run as ./organiseInFS.sh ../poms/ ../poms/parser*.pom 
* update angularjs app to refer to poms in organised pom structure
* need to create json pom list from organised poms. the pom list should be of the format:
{ "poms" : [
{ "name" : ORIGINAL-POM,
  "version" : VERSION,
  "artifact" : ARTIFACT }*
]
}
* Update angularjs read json pom list and create an accordian list on the left hand side which opens up version->artifact->poms.
